This data is a visualization on the number of active shooters in the United States between the Years of 2000-2015. It gained a lot of popularity and was used in magazines. But its popularity struck conversations if data is allowed to influence with emotions. One analysist said that data should be simple and be as neutral as possible, the more neutral the more true and less persuasive it is. Some people argued that persuastion is in all data, even spreadsheets-- as information provokes reactions. They explain it as if the viewer can see everything all at once.
  The god trick and its underlying assumptions about neutrality and truth are baked into todayâ€™s best practices for data visualization. This is largely due to the influence of one man: the renowned statistical graphics expert Edward Tufte. Back in the 1980s, Tufte invented a metric for measuring the amount of superfluous information included in a chart. He called it the data-ink ratio. In his view, a visualization designer should strive to use ink to display data alone. Any ink devoted to something other than the data themselvesâ€”such as background color, iconography, or embellishmentâ€”is a suspect and intruder to the graphic. (Data Feminism,2020)
 ## Data viz Biograpghy
 **Who or what institution produced the visualization? (Hint: refer to "Figure Credits")** 
 The images were produced by Christopher Ingraham from the Washington Post, but the original graph was created by the FBI
**When was it produced?**
I can not find a produced date, but it was published in 2020.
**Who is the audience for the visualization?**
The audience is anyone that stumbled arcoss it, mainly in magazines and news articles on social enviornments.
**How might the visualization be interpreted or misinterpreted? What consequences might this interpretation/misinterpretation have?**
I think the visualizations can be interpreted as a concern of growing numbers of Shooters in the US. Some condequences if it was interpreted incorrectly is that it might provoke an unwanted emotion and get the facts mixed up, causing misinformation to be spread.
**How, if at all, does the data visualization represent power or systems?**
I do not think it represents power as it is a basic fact bar graph, but I can see it display power due to emotions it might provoke within the audience.
